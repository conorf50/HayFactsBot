        "Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut and dried to be stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for large grazing animals raised as livestock, such as cattle, horses, donkeys, goats, and sheep",
        "Hay can also be fed to smaller domesticated animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs",
        "Pigs can also eat hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as ruminants",
        "Hay can be used as animal fodder when or where there is not enough pasture or rangeland on which to graze an animal, when grazing is not feasible due to weather (such as during the winter), or when lush pasture by itself would be too rich for the health of the anima",
        "Hay can be fed when an animal is unable to access pasture - for example, if the animal is being kept in a stable or barn.",
        "Commonly used plants for hay include mixtures of grasses such as ryegrass (Lolium species), timothy, brome, fescue, Bermuda grass, orchard grass, and other species, depending on region.",
        "Legumes in hay are ideally cut pre-bloom.",
        "Other pasture forbs (examples of which include clovers, sunflowers, daylilies, and milkweed) are also sometimes a part of the hay mix, though these plants are not necessarily desired as certain forbs are toxic to some animals"
