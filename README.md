# HayFactsBot
A Discord chatbot that gives you facts about hay. Makes use of the Serenity crate https://crates.io/crates/serenity

## Background Info
This started as a joke among friends, and got a little out of hand. I've made this silly creation open source purely for fun. Even though we don't use this anymore, maybe it'll be of use to someone.

Most of the references come from this Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay

## Running
You'll need the following env vars set
- GUILD_ID
- DISCORD_TOKEN
- APPLICATION_ID
